# Issue Tracker App

## Overview

Welcome to the Issue Tracker App! This is a simple application built using Spring Boot, MySQL, and React. 
The purpose of this project is to create a basic issue tracker that allows users to manage and track issues in a collaborative environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Node.js and npm
- MySQL Database

### Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/issue-tracker.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd issue-tracker
    ```

3. Configure MySQL:

    - Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` and set up your MySQL database credentials.

4. Start the Spring Boot backend:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

5. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

6. Start the React frontend:
